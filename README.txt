This project attempts to implement the environment access API, as
specified in CLTL2, on Common Lisp impelementations which do not
provide the API to the programmer. Some implementations implement the
CLTL2 environments API however deviate it or behave differently in
subtle ways. This project aims to provide a compatibility layer
providing a uniform API, using the implementation specific
functionality when possible.
